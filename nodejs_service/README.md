## Running the backend

In order to run the API, you need to first install all the requirements. Run either `npm install` or `yarn` to install all the requirements. This should create a `node_modules/` folder which should hold the various packages you require to run the frontend.

Then, you can run `npm start` or `yarn start` (depending on whether you are using `npm` or `yarn`). It will start the API at [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

Note: any time you make a change to the backend, you will need to restart it to see those changes reflected through the api/browser.
