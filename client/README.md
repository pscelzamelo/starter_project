This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running the frontend

In order to run the frontend, you need to first install all the requirements. Run either `npm install` or `yarn` to install all the requirements. This should create a `node_modules/` folder which should hold the various packages you require to run the frontend.

Then, you can run `npm start` or `yarn start` (depending on whether you are using `npm` or `yarn`). It will open a browser window at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) displaying your page.

Note: The page will reload if you make edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
